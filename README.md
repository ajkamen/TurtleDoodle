# TurtleDoodle
Old piece of code I built approximately 4 years ago for when i first started coding.

Requires: 
python installed on your computer. 
Knowing how to use a .py program from terminal
Have python graphics (the thing used for python drawings, this is a stupid turtle doodle)

Instructions: 
Download both .py files, put them in the same folder
Run minecraftswords.py
It'll draw some swords using a turtle, takes a while. It's really old and i made it for a coding class. I literally just grabbed it from an old private repository and moved it here. Works fine.
